    "content": "<p>Building my first web project was both challenging and rewarding. I started with a simple idea: create a to‑do list application to help me manage my coursework and extracurricular activities. Armed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I set out to design a user interface that was clean and intuitive.</p><p>Along the way I learned the importance of breaking features into small, manageable tasks. I experimented with layout techniques, responsive design, and DOM manipulation. When it came time to add persistence, I opted for the browser's local storage API. Deploying the finished app taught me about hosting options and how to use version control effectively.</p><p>This project laid the foundation for everything that followed. It gave me confidence to tackle bigger challenges and sparked a passion for building tools that make life a little easier.</p>"
